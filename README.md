# temp-logger
An Arduino sketch using a combination of example files to make a temperature/humidity logger with the adafruit datalogging shield and an AM2302 sensor on pin 3

There is also a Procesing sketch to visualize the data from the SD card. Run the Processing sketch, and open the .CSV file you want from the SD card, or wherever.
